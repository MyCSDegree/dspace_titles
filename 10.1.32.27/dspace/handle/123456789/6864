Sixteen fungal samples, collected from saw mill wastes, were screened for
their laccase producing ability. Five isolates were selected, based on their quantity
of laccase enzyme production, for the study. Trametes versicolor was found to be
the suitable fungi, among the isolates, in terms of laccase enzyme production.
Semi-synthetic media and agro waste based media were screened for their support
for laccase enzyme production and it was found that sapota seed based media
supported the maximum laccase enzyme production (2.34 U/ml). The media
optimization was carried out by classical and statistical methods. In classical
method, the effect of various carbon and nitrogen sources along with the effect of
temperature, pH and shaking speed were studied and it was found that glucose
was the best carbon source, peptone best nitrogen source, 30°C optimum
temperature, 6.0 as the optimum pH and 150 rpm as the best shaking speed for
maximum laccase enzyme production viz., 2.61 U/ml. Vermi wash was used as a
nutritional supplement in the culture media and it was found that 50%
concentration of vermi wash supported the good growth of fungi and laccase
enzyme production (2.74 U/ml). The statistical optimization method was used to
study the interactive effect of various nutrients on laccase enzyme production in
agro waste (sapota seed) based culture media. Response –to –surface
methodology was used for the study. 15 nutrients were screened by Plackettvi
Burman method and it was found that 5 nutrients had potential impact on laccase
enzyme production. The 5 nutrients were further evaluated by Box-Benhken
method and the optimum values of these 5 nutrients were evaluated. Finally, an
optimized media was formulated and it was used for laccase enzyme production
by T.versicolor, it yielded 2.94 U/ml of laccase enzyme. The laccase enzyme
produced was purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation followed by dialysis
and column chromatography methods and the molecular weight was found to be
55kDa. The temperature and pH optima were calculated.
The applications of laccase enzymes were studied. The five isolates were
screened for their Acid orange-7 bio-decolourization and it was found that
Phanerochaete chrysosporium was the best among the isolates. The
decolourization in solid media (SDA), liquid media (SDB) and mineral salt media
(MS) were studied. Five concentrations of Acid orange-7 were tested (0.01%,
0.05%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 0.76% and 1.0%) and the maximum decolourization was seen
with 0.01% (98.9%). The optimization of the decolourization was also done. The
ability of laccase enzyme (free and immobilized) was also studied and it was
found that immobilized laccase enzyme has less decolourization potential than free
enzyme.
The delignification of Eucalyptus sp. by the five isolates was studied and it
was found that Phanerochaete chrysosporium was the best delignifying organism.
vii
The addition of glucose and peptone were found to increase the delignification
percentage and the maximum delignification obtained was 94.6%.
Similarly the degradation of cypermethrin was carried out and Aspergillus
fumigatus was found to be the best degrader of cypermethrin. The optimization of
cypermethrin degradation was also carried out. Laccase enzyme resulted in the
maximum degradation of 99.2%.
The result showed that the sapota seed can be effectively used as a substrate
for the laccase enzyme production. Trametes versicolor is the best laccase
enzyme producer. Laccase enzyme can successfully be used for the environmental
pollution control such as Acid orange-7 bio-decolourization, delignification of
Eucalyptus sp. and also in the degradation of cypermethrin.</td></tr>
