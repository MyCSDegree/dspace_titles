<tr><td class="metadataFieldLabel">Abstract:&nbsp;</td><td class="metadataFieldValue">Carbon fiber reinforced polymeric (CFRP) composite materials possess
their own unique mechanical as well as functional properties, which is attributed to
the combination of their constituent materials that has desirable properties. The
above said constituents are generally available as carbon fiber reinforcement
positioned in the polymer resin. The salient properties such as high strength-toweight
ratio, wear resistance, corrosion resistance makes CFRP composite materials
highly suitable for various key applications namely aerospace, automobiles, sporting
goods, biomedical, to name a few. Though composite materials are manufactured to
near net shape, often subsequent machining is found necessary to achieve desired
dimensional accuracy and tolerance.
Machining is a broad term used to describe removal of material from a
workpiece in the form of chips of various types such as continuous, discontinuous,
etc., Traditional materials such as steel, aluminum and their alloys are isotropic,
because they have same properties irrespective of the direction of measurement. But
in the case of CFRP materials, the properties vary with respect to the direction. Also
properties of material vary layer by layer. This is because the way in which these
materials are reinforced. Thus they are considered to be anisotropic and
heterogeneous. Machining of composites has been undertaken to a large extent
because of its increasing use in replacing conventional materials for various
applications and even to transform the raw material from one shape to another shape
of interest. But due to the excellent mechanical properties, their heterogeneity,
sensitivity to heat, and the extremely abrasive nature of fibers, machining of fiber
reinforced composite materials is perceived as a highly difficult task.
v
Once material is machined, then it is the concern of how good its surface
would be. CFRP is also not exceptional to this criterion. Surface roughness of CFRP
composites requires more and more analysis due to the presence of abrasive nature
of fibers. Surface roughness is one of the important parameters in the evaluation of
accuracy in machined components. Though, various factors such as work material,
cutting tool material, machine tool condition, cutting fluid, etc., affect the surface
roughness of any machined component, machining parameters such as cutting speed,
feed and depth of cut have great influence. Also during the process of turning,
composite material induces various damages such as fiber pull-out, fiber bending,
matrix cracking, spalling and fuzzing.
Investigation on CFRP composite materials, particularly on turning
process is not reported much. Further, the quality of turned surfaces could be
evaluate in terms of performance factors such as surface roughness, machining
force, power consumption and specific cutting pressure. In addition, there is no
sufficient modeling and optimization on composite materials carried out in turning
CFRP composite materials. Therefore, this research work focuses on the
experimental work in turning of CFRP composite materials using three cutting tool
materials such as Polycrystalline diamond (PCD), Cubic boron nitride (CBN) and
Cemented Carbide (K15) considering four different response parameters. Modeling
and optimization of process parameters also is carried out and presented in this
research work.
CFRP composite materials are prepared in the form of tube using
filament winding method. The resin used is of unsaturated isophthalic polyester
resin mixed with the 2% of hardener hard cobalt napthanate and accelerator methane
ethane ketone peroxide. Turning operation is carried out on Lathe (NAGMATI
make) using different single point cutting tools such as by varying various
machining parameters. The machining parameters used for machining are cutting
speed, feed and depth of cut.
vi
The experiments are carried out using full factorial design of Taguchi’s
L27 orthogonal array meaning 27 experiments. The machining parameters used are
of three levels in each cutting speed, feed and depth of cut. They are three levels of
cutting speed 75 m/min, 100 m/min and 125 m/min; feed of 0.1 mm/rev, 0.15
mm/rev and 0.2 mm/rev; and depth of cut of 0.5 mm, 1 mm and 1.5 mm. In this
research work, four different response parameters are studied such as machining
force, surface roughness, machining power and specific cutting pressure in turning
of CFRP composite materials. Among the cutting tools used, PCD tool offered better
performance.
Forces are measured during turning operation. Surface roughness of
machined composite is measured using Taylor-Hobson surface roughness measuring
equipment after turning process is completed. Subsequently machining power and
specific cutting pressure were determined. Then analysis was carried out on the
surface roughness and machining force to find the significance of machining
parameters that could yield a better surface roughness and machining force,
machining power and specific cutting pressure.
Modeling was developed to predict response parameters using Response
Surface Methodology. The empirical equations are developed for each response
using regression modeling techniques for determination of non linear relationship
between the chosen responses and the turning parameters. The R-sq value, which is
the coefficient of correlation, is used for checking the regression models and it is
more or less equal to unity pointing out that the developed model is good in
agreement with the experimental values.
Another methodology Fuzzy logic is used for developing models using
different membership functions. The results predicted by these methodologies are
compared with that of the experimental values. Correlation between the results was
analyzed using the average checking error. Optimal membership function was
chosen based on the minimum error occurred against experimental value.
vii
Machining parameters were optimized using Grey Relational Analysis
for a suitable combination of turning parameters for machining CFRP composites to
obtain better result.
The turned surface of CFRP composite materials are observed using
macro photographs taken with 4X magnification for reviewing the damages due to
the turning operation. The machined surface are analysed using SEM images
revealed the damages encountered due to turning process. The major issues
identified are fiber pullout, matrix cracking, uncut fibers found on the surface of the
machined workpiece to name a few. Surface roughness and machining force
increases with the increase of feed, but decreases with the increase of cutting speed.
Machining power increases with the increase of any machining parameter. Specific
cutting pressure decreased when increasing the feed but increasing if cutting speed
and depth of cut are increased. Among the methodologies used for developing
models for prediction of response variables, fuzzy logic offers the best result closer
to the experimental one than the response regression technique. Further, among the
membership functions used, bell shaped membership function was the closer
agreement with the experimental results. Grey relational analysis also offered
desired results to coincide with the experimentation. In addition, ANOVA tables are
also developed to find out the most influential machining parameter and the
percentage of contributions. It is observed from the ANOVA tables that the feed is
the most influential factor subsequently followed by cutting speed and depth of cut.
Similarly, parametric influence on each four response also is studied and the
interaction plots are analysed and presented.</td></tr>
