pharmaceutical industries. They are found in many plant species and have a wide
range of biological properties which makes them an interesting research subject.
The small shrubs or tree Memecylon edule is used in traditional medicine against
various diseases. The first part of the present research study was aimed at the
production and enhancement of saponin by means of in vitro culture; isolation of
saponin from M.edule leaves in vivo. The other part of this study covered two
aspects. The first aspect related to results of experiments on the possible
pharmacological uses of M.edule saponin from haemolytic, pisicidal, insecticidal,
anticancer, antioxidant and antimicrobial angles. The second aspect touched a new
field namely that M.edule extract is a good source for the green synthesis of gold
and silver nanoparticles. A detailed narrative follows.
The aim of the study was focused on in vitro culture of Memecylon edule
for producing saponin and to study the cell growth rate. Leaf and nodal segments of
Memecylon edule were cultured on half and full strength Murashige and skoog
(MS) medium and Woody plant medium (WPM) which also contained different
concentrations of growth regulators and antioxidants. For the first time, this study
has standardized the medium and hormone combination to initiate callus from
M.edule. The green and brown friable callus and brown compact callus were
induced from nodal segments and white compact callus was induced from leaf of
M.edule. The callus growth was higher when grown in half strength MS medium
supplemented with NAA 1mg/l + BAP 1mg/l + GA3 2.5 mg/l + KN 1mg/l
compared to WPM supplemented with BAP 1mg/l + KN 1mg/l + 2,4,D 0.5mg/l
viii
+NAA 1.5mg/l +IAA 1mg/l. The callus growth from nodal segments in half
strength MS medium and WPM with above hormone concentrations was obtained
on 26th and 37th day respectively.
Accumulation of saponin and the growth rate of cells in suspension
culture of M.edule during a period of 30 days were tested using various calli
obtained from leaf and nodal segments. The cells exhibited a slower growth rate
during the first 5-7 days of culture, and thereafter, a rapid growth rate was observed
upto day 20. On day 20 the fresh and dry weights of cells in suspension were 8.02,
0.58 g/l and the saponin yield was 70.06 mg/l in half strength MS medium
containing similar hormone combinations used in callus culture. Above cells of
suspension culture transferred into high saponin production medium with NAA
1mg/l + 2,4,D 1mg/l + BAP 0.5 mg/l + IBA 1mg/l over a growth period of 30 days
indicated dynamic changes during the day 15 to 20 . The cells were tested in light
and dark conditions with different inoculum levels for establishing the suspension
culture for high saponin production. The results indicated that the highest content of
saponin, i.e., 82.36 mg/l was observed in dark condition with 15% inoculum and a
lesser yield was obtained in light condition. After 10 days of incubation, the protein
and glucose contents gradually increased in suspension culture of M.edule. Callus
and suspension culture of M.edule was extracted for saponin. Further saponin
content in crude extract of callus and in cells of suspension culture was determined
by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and high performance
thin layer chromatographic method. The results indicated that the saponin was
eluted in C18 column under specified conditions with retention time of 3.516 min
in HPLC chromatogram for M.edule saponin and retention time of 3.572 min for
standard saponin. The total saponin increased two fold after transfer to the half
strength MS medium containing fungal elicitor in various concentrations and
precursor. The optimal concentration of sucrose, nitrogen, phosphate, ammonia
enhanc ed the saponin production. The results showed that fungal homogenates
increased the saponin content on 20th day. Further saponin content was determined
by high performance liquid chromatographic method. The results indicated that the
ix
highest content of saponin was obtained in cell suspension culture on (half or full
strength) MS medium supplemented with NAA 1mg/l, KN 0.2mg/l, 2,4,D 1.5mg/l.
As regards to deriving saponin in vivo from Memecylon edule, its leaf,
stem and root were subjected to hot extraction (soxhlet apparatus) using petroleum
ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, absolute ethanol, 70% ethanol and water to
determine the effect of extraction solvent and saponin recovery. Only the leaf and
stem yielded significant traces of saponin, and that too only when 70 % ethanol or
water used. The results indicated that high yield was obtainable when water was
used. The water extract of leaf was further purified by using various solvents
including diethyl ether, cholesterol and pyridine and the obtained saponin was
hygroscopic in nature. Identity of saponin was confirmed by using HPLC and its
purity was confirmed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometric method.
This HPLC assay performed on a reversed phase C18 column with gradient elution
of acetonitrile and 0.01% formic acid in 30 minutes. Standard saponin purchased
from Hi Media showed the retention time of 3.572 min and the M.edule saponin in
this study showed similar peak at retention time of 3.502 min. The results of
ICPMS method showed the presence of potassium and calcium in the purified
saponin of M.edule and the same metals were present at a lower detection level in
standard saponin. The saponin characterization was done in the M.edule extract by
using spectrophotometric methods including liquid chromatography, mass
spectrometry, Fourier transform infra red spectrometry, Nuclear magnetic resonance
spectrometry. Saponin related to the peak area of 1373.9 exhibited protonated,
ammoniated and sodiated adducts. FTIR spectrum exhibited peak at 1631.61 in
standard saponin and at 1609.62 in M.edule saponin. The results for nuclear
magnetic resonance showed saponin in the sugar proton signals in the region
between 3.0 -5.5 ppm. The figures were in accordance with the norms.
The aqueous extract of saponin was tested for its various
pharmacological properties. Haemolytic activity was strong in 0.5 and 1mg/ml
concentration with the diffusion range of 5.5 and 9 mm respectively. The pisicidal
activity was observed at a higher concentration level 1mg /ml and there was low
x
xi
mortality in 48 h. Insecticidal activity against maggots of musca domestica was
observed at higher concentrations of saponin of M.edule. Anticancer activity was
observed against breast cancer cells (MCF 7) at a concentration of 1mg/ml. The
result of anti oxidant activity tested by DPPH and reducing power method, showed
a strong scavenging activity at concentrations of 0.1 and 0.2 mg/ml. Antimicrobial
activity was tested in respect of 10 bacteria and at a concentration of 50 mg/ml, the
activity was found against three bacteria namely Staphylococcus aureus,
Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.
That Memecylon edule leaf extract was found to be a good source for the
green synthesis of gold and silver nanoparticles. The aqueous leaf extract of
M.edule reacted with aqueous solution of silver and chloroauric acid and rapid
formation of stable gold and silver nanoparticles at different time intervels has been
established for the first time in this study. TEM analysis showed that the gold
nanoparticles were produced within 2 h of adding the leaf extract to 1mM silver
nitrate solution and these particles were triangular, circular and hexagonal in shape
and their size range was 10-40 nm. EDAX showed the presence of gold in the
adsorption peak of 2.30 Kev.
SEM analysis covered the gold and silver. The gold particles were found in
higher range than silver; nanotriangular shape with the irregular edges were
measured in the range of 20 to 50 nm. SEM analysis of silver nanioparticles showed
that the shape was hexagonal and triangular in the dimension range of 45-60 nm.
The EDAX pattern of gold and silver nanoparticles in SEM analysis showed that the
presence of gold /silver in the adsorption peak of 2.30 Kev/ 3.1 Kev. Further FTIR
analysis was also done for identifying the functional groups in gold and silver
nanoparticles of M.edule.
The investigations in this study established (i) In vitro culture of
M.edule by evolving suitable procedures for such culture; (ii) Saponin production
from M.edule which is a pioneer aspect (iii) The pharmaceutical effects of
M.edule saponin (iiii) The use of the extract of M.edule in green synthesis of gold
and silver nanoparticles which is also new.</td></tr>
