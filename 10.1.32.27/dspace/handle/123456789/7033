<tr><td class="metadataFieldLabel">Abstract:&nbsp;</td><td class="metadataFieldValue">During the last few decades semiconductor based computational power
doubled every eighteen months as predicted by Intel co-founder G. Moore.
This rapid growth is mainly based on an increase in the number of transistors
per unit area and an increase of clock speed. If this trend in miniaturization
was to be continued, the size of electronic components would reach the
molecular scale within ten years.
If top-down approaches in fabricating electronic devices as used in the
semiconductor industries for last few decades are adopted for further down
scaling, quantum phenomena such as tunneling cannot be avoided and the
control of doping is also problematic in the ultra small nano scale devices.
Even if these problems might be overcome, a strong increase of processing
and fabrication costs appears inevitable.
Hence, it is natural to suggest building up electronic components with a
bottom-up approach. Nowadays many researchers are exploring new device
architectures, to be built by bottom-up techniques and have received great
attention in recent years. Molecular electronics is believed to be one of the
very potential technologies in nano scale regime beyond the limit of silicon
technology.
vii
There is a hope for the realization of circuit elements, built from such
systems which outclass todayâ€™s electronic circuits with respect to both
efficiency and miniaturization. This is still a field of intense fundamental
research, the reason being the impact on the measured conductance properties
due to both the chemical nature of the molecule and its bonding to the lead
surfaces is not consistently understood. Because of this lack of understanding,
intense theoretical studies go along with the experiments. The ultimate aim of
this work is to correlate the molecular electronic structure with the conduction
properties in a predictive manner, which would be a crucial step towards a
directed design of molecular electronic devices.
The first chapter of the thesis deals with the motivation of the research
work. We have listed the limitations of the top down approaches and the need
for bottom up approach. We have discussed the various approaches to
fabricate nano scale devices with elaborate explanation of the molecular
electronics. We have explained how the molecule is sandwitched between two
electrodes and how this configuration can be partitioned to be represented
mathematically. Theoretically this separation is useful to be treated by
quantum chemical method.
In the second chapter the theoretical methods that are adopted for
modeling the system is detailed. We start with the schrodinger equation which
helps to represent the molecule on the Hamiltonian form and how the energy
levels are described. We analyse how the Fermi energy of the molecule is
viii
determined and the significance of the electro chemical potential (Fermi level)
for a single molecule. When the molecule is attached to the contact it does not
remain neutral but picks up a fractional charge which shifts the Fermi level up
or down. In this chapter we also note the molecular energy levels like HOMO
&amp; LUMO are involved in charge distribution. The theoretical model to
simulate electron flow through the molecular device, developed in this work is
explained in detail.
The third chapter of this thesis is dedicated to show how the
conductance properties of a molecular electronic device are influenced by
change in geometrical alignment of the molecule bridging the electrodes. We
present the modeling results due to variation in the attachment of the leads to
the molecules. The effect of isomers has profound impact on electrical
properties of the device. Significant properties are noted when the charging
parameter is varied the transport challenges faced in the molecular device is
addressed in detail.
The fourth chapter is directed to model the conductance at the interface.
We start the analysis with a simpler case of varying the distance between the
molecule and the gold contacts. The results shows transmission is changed or
reduced as the distance is changed. The molecule is not directly attached to the
electrodes but rather through linkers. We have analysed the influence of
different linkage on transport properties. The result shows that the interface
between the gold electrodes and the linkage also called anchors plays a vital
ix
role in the electrical characteristics. The results are discussed. This chapter
also deals with asymmetric or non linear characteristics of the molecular
junction. The device which shows a ohmic behavior produced non-linear
characteristics when the coupling at the junction is non symmetrical.
The fifth chapter is devoted to the application of the model to simulate
few simple molecular devices in electronics industries. The goal of molecular
electronics is to fabricate nano device conductors, diodes, rectifiers, memory
devices &amp; switches that are equivalent to semiconductor devices. We have
simulated these devices to prove that the existing semiconductor technology
can be replaced by molecular devices. These theoretical results will contribute
to the design and fabrication of molecular electronics devices in future.
The sixth chapter summarizes the results of the present investigations
and also suggests the possible work that can be continued further. The results
of the above investigation have been published in the international journals
and also presented in various national and international c</td></tr>
