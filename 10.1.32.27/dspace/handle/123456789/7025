<tr><td class="metadataFieldLabel">Abstract:&nbsp;</td><td class="metadataFieldValue">Plants are considered to be promising source of medicine in the
traditional health care system. They have stood the test of time for their
safety, efficacy, cultural acceptability and lesser side effects. The chemical
constituents present in them are responsible for the physiological functions of
living flora and hence they are believed to have better compatibility with the
human body. Keeping therefore in view, the growing interest of the use of
herbal drugs the present study was undertaken with a view to evaluate the
pharmacognostical, phytochemical and pharmacological activities of the
leaves of Symplocos cochinchinensis (Lour.).
Pharmacognostical standardization has emerged as one of the
fundamental necessity aimed at the confirmation of the origin of the herbal
drugs to safely include them as certified raw material in requisite
formulations. Pharmacognostical standardization seems therefore of prime
importance and can be assessed by the following perspectives like
macroscopy, microscopy and physico-chemical constants.
In the present study macroscopy, microscopy of the leaves, stem,
petiole and bark, physico-chemical constants, histochemical analysis,
fluorescence analysis and inorganic mineral analysis of the leaves were
carried out. These standards are used to ensure the identification and
authentication of the plant in crude and fragmentary form for industrial and
v
further research purpose. Any significant deviation in the percentage of any
parameters reported in this work may indicate adulteration or substitution in
the drug.
The shade dried powdered plant material was subjected to
successive soxhlet extraction with n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and
methanol. The various extracts were then subjected to preliminary
phytochemical analysis which revealed the presence of steroids,
carbohydrates, phenols, flavanoids, glycosides, proteins, saponins and
alkaloids.
Qualitative chromatographic analysis of these extracts using thin
layer chromatography was performed to separate and identify the single or
mixture of components present in each extract. High performance thin layer
chromatography (HPTLC) fingerprint profiles of the extracts were also
carried out. HPTLC fingerprint is one of the versatile tool for qualitative and
quantitative analysis of active constituents. It is also a diagnostic method to
find out the adulterants and to check the purity.
All the extracts were subjected to in-vitro pharmacological studies
to select the best therapeutically active extract for in-vivo pharmacological
activity. In-vitro cytotoxic activity was carried out using human cancer cell
lines namely Human breast cancer- MDA-MB-231, Colon cancer-SW 620
and Liver cancer - Hep G 2. Anti-inflammatory activity was carried out by
human red blood cell (HRBC) membrane stabilization method and anti-snake
venom activity was carried out by inhibition of HRBC lysis method. Among
vi
the four extracts methanol extract showed significant in-vitro pharmacological
activity and it was selected for the in-vivo pharmacological activity.
In-vivo pharmacological activity like hepatoprotective,
anti-inflammatory, anti-snake venom and anti-cancer activities were carried
out for methanolic extract. Acute toxicity study was carried out for methanol
extract using Acute Toxic Class Method as described in OECD Guidelines
No. 423 (Organization of Economic Co-Operation and Development). The
methanolic extract was safe up to a dose of 2000 mg/kg body weight and the
dose levels were fixed as 200 and 400mg/kg of body weight.
Hepatoprotective activity was carried out using carbon tetrachloride
(CCl4) induced hepatotoxicity in rats. The serum hepatic marker enzyme
levels were significantly increased in the CCl4 treated group as a result of
hepatic damage which was significantly retrieved to normal level by treatment
with the extract. The extract treatment also restored the altered antioxidant
enzyme levels towards normal in a dose dependant manner in CCl4 induced
hepatic damage. All the results were comparable with that of standard
Silymarin treated groups.
The in-vivo anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated by
carrageenan induced paw oedema model in rats. The methanolic extract at
400 mg/kg showed significant reduction in the oedema which was comparable
with that of the standard drug Diclofenac. In in-vivo anti-snake venom activity
it was observed that the percentage survival of the mice increased
significantly in extract treated groups in a dose dependant manner when
compared to control group.
vii
Anti-cancer activity was carried out using Dalton’s ascitic
lymphoma (DAL) cell lines. Treatment with methanolic extract at 200mg and
400mg/kg reduced the tumor volume, packed cell volume (PCV) and viable
tumor cell count in dose dependent manner as compared to DAL control
group of animals. The non-viable tumor cell counts, mean survival time were
increased in extract treated groups. Extract treatment retrieved all the
haematological parameters to normal level.
The methanolic extract was column chromatographed to isolate
the individual compounds. Three compounds were isolated from the extract
and their structures were elucidated by spectral studies. The oleanolic acid
derivative isolated from the extract was studied for in-vivo anti-cancer
activity. It showed potent anti-cancer activity by increasing the life span of
animals and retrieving all the haematological parameters to normal level.
The present investigation is aimed on the evaluation of
Pharmacognosy, Phytochemistry and Pharmacological activities of the leaves
of Symplocos cochinchinensis (Lour.) will fill up the lacuna in our
knowledge of the plant. The scope of this research work is to provide
scientific evaluation of an important plant with promising therapeutic activity.
The study aims to add a new plant to Indian medicinal plant armory and
Indian System of Medicine.</td></tr>
