Vegetable oils are attractive as alternative fuels for diesel engines,
since they are renewable in nature and can be directly used as fuels in diesel
engines. However, their high viscosity and poor volatility lead to reduced
brake thermal efficiency and increased hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide and
smoke emissions. In the present work, different methods to improve the
performance of a cotton seed oil fuelled diesel engine were investigated.
A single cylinder water-cooled, direct injection diesel engme
developing a power output of 5.2 kW at 1500 rpm was used for conducting the
experiments. Tests were conducted at a constant speed of 1500 rpm with
variable load conditions. Base data was generated with diesel and neat cotton
seed oil. Subsequently, cotton seed oil was converted into its ethyl ester by
transesterification process. Cotton seed oil was also blended with diesel or
orange oil in different proportions and tested. Further, cotton seed oil or its
blend with diesel was preheated at different temperatures and performance
improvement was found out at various loads. In the next phase of the work,
experiments were conducted using oxygenates like diethyl ether. In the last
phase, the engine was converted into a semi adiabatic engine and experiments
were conducted using cotton seed oil as fuel.
Use of neat cotton seed oil in a diesel engine results in reduced
brake thermal efficiency, higher smoke, hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide
emissions. Brake thermal efficiency is 28% with neat cotton seed oil and
32.3% with diesel at full load. It improves to 30.4% with the ethyl ester of
cotton seed oil. Smoke level for neat cotton seed oil is 3.9 BSU and 3.7 BSU
for its ester at full load. In the case of diesel, it is 3.4 BSU. NO emission with
ethyl ester of cotton seed oil increases from 703 ppm to 765 ppm at full load
due to higher combustion temperature. Due to poor mixture formation
tendency of cotton seed oil, the premixed heat release rate is low but it
improves with its ester operation, thereby improves the combustion
characteristics such as peak pressure, maximum rate of pressure rise, ignition
delay and combustion duration.
Blending of cotton seed oil with either orange oil or diesel improves
the engine performance and emissions. With an optimum blend of 15% orange
oil by volume with cotton seed oil, brake thermal efficiency is 30.4% whereas
with 40% of diesel blend, it is 30.5%. Brake thermal efficiency of neat cotton
seed oil is 28%. Smoke level, HC and CO decreases with blending of orange
oil or diesel. Ignition delay and combustion duration are lower than neat
cotton seed oil for its blends with orange oil or diesel. At full load, the ignition
delay and combustion duration are 9°CA and 41°CA respectively for the
optimum blend of 15% orange oil compared to 12°CA and 44°CA for neat
cotton seed oil. Same combustion parameters for 40% diesel blend are 9°CA
and 38°CA respectively. These improvements in combustion parameters by
blending orange oil or diesel with cotton seed oil are due to improved
premixed combustion rate.
Preheating neat cotton seed oil or its blends with diesel significantly
lowers the viscosity, improves mixture formation and combustion, resulting in
better brake thermal efficiency and lower emissions. Over all engme
performance is far better for the preheated cotton seed oil-diesel blends
compared to preheated neat cotton seed oil. Brake thermal efficiency for 40%
diesel blend preheated to 90°C is 30.5% where as it is 28.8% for preheated
cotton seed oil at 11 O°e. Higher reduction in HC, CO and smoke emission is
observed with preheating of blends compared to preheating neat cotton seed
oil only. However, NO emission is 741 ppm for 40% diesel blend at 90°C
which is higher than preheating cotton seed oil only (712 ppm). Higher
cylinder peak pressure and maximum rate of pressure rise are observed with
preheating the 40% diesel blend at 90°C. Ignition delay and combustion
duration for 40% diesel blend with cotton seed oil preheated to 90°C are the
same as that of diesel values (9°CA and 38°CA respectively)
Blending oxygenate (diethyl ether) with cotton seed oil increases the
brake thermal efficiency at all loads due to enhanced combustion rate. At full
load, with an optimum blend of 30% diethyl ether, the brake thermal
VII
efficiency increases to 29.5% from 28% for neat cotton seed oil. There is a
reduction in the HC, CO and smoke level at all loads with diethyl ether
blending. However, NO emission increases from 703 ppm for neat cotton seed
oil to 737 ppm for the optimum blend due to higher combustion temperature.
Premixed combustion rate and hence the heat release rate in the initial stages
of combustion increases by blending diethyl ether with cotton seed oil
Use of neat cotton seed oil in a semi-adiabatic diesel engine
improves the brake thermal efficiency up to 60% of load after which it tends to
fall. At higher loads, of all the methods tested, exhaust temperature is the
highest in cotton seed oil fuelled semi-adiabatic diesel engine. This exhaust
gas retained in the cylinder reduces the volumetric efficiency considerably.
Hence, poor availability of oxygen impairs the combustion leading to lower
brake thermal efficiency and higher exhaust emissions.
Among the methods investigated, 15% orange oil blend with cotton
seed oil is the best method to use cotton seed oil in a diesel engine with respect
to performance, fuel economy, emissions, combustion characteristics and
simplicity in using the cotton seed oil-orange oil blend.</td></tr>
