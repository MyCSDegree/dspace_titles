The purpose of this thesis is to study techniques for achieving Fault Diagnosis and Identification (FDI) using estimation procedures and to identify conditions for imparting Fault Tolerant Control (FTC) schemes on systems. The systems are broadly classified into discrete, continuous and hybrid systems and the studies are focussed on achieving combined FDI and FTC on the systems individually.
FDI is a key component of many operation management automation (here the term automation refers to the kind of system) systems, where fault diagnosis pinpoints one or more root causes of problems, to the point where corrective action can be taken and fault identification recognizes that a problem has occurred even if the root cause is not completely known. A detailed study on earlier applied techniques revealed that the system models developed for achieving FDI were either based on timed automaton (here the term automaton refers to the modeling technique) or state models, which resulted in problems such as tuning of phases or state explosion. For this purpose, concepts of Petri nets were utilized for modeling the systems wherein the problems related to state explosion and tuning of phases were avoided and also suitable for achieving FDI alone. Once FDI is achieved it is also necessary to design control systems which are capable of tolerating potential faults in these systems in order to improve the reliability and availability while providing a desirable performance. These types of control systems are often known as Fault-Tolerant Control Systems (FTCSs). More precisely, FTCSs are control systems which possess the ability to accommodate component failures automatically. They are capable of maintaining overall system stability and
vi
acceptable performance in the event of such failures. Hence, the proposed research work is based on modeling the systems in Petri net environment and applying techniques for achieving combined FDI and FTC in systems.
Petri nets as defined in literature are a combination of model-based and graphical-based approach, highly useful in performing qualitative based analysis for diagnosing faults and for devising fault tolerant schemes. Based on the modelling power of Petri nets, the systems can be modeled as event driven systems and analyzed accordingly. For this purpose in the research work, typical systems classified as Discrete Event Dynamic Systems (DEDSs), Continuous Event Systems (CESs) and Hybrid Event Systems (HESs) are analyzed by modeling the systems using discrete, continuous and hybrid Petri nets individually. In the proposed methodology, discrete Petri nets are used in modeling the control logic applied in systems and continuous Petri nets are utilized to model flows. But the nature of flow can be disrupted due to irregular operation of valves, sensors, pumps, etc. Hence, hybrid Petri nets are utilized to model systems along with their faulty behavior and analyzed.
After successful modeling and analysis of the models developed in Petri net environment through numerical and graphical approaches, fault diagnosis procedures and fault tolerant schemes are proposed and applied to various benchmark systems and are simulated. For this purpose, structural properties of Petri nets such as reachability, observability and controllability are utilized and based on the literature study done, algorithms to achieve combined FDI and FTC on the benchmark systems are proposed along with numerical results.
vii
Next, based on real time data procured from an industrial process (petroleum refinery), studies are made to diagnose faults on various sub-system models of the process and results are obtained. This is followed with the application of proposed techniques on typical sequential processes, such as bottle filling system, and sewage treatment system to achieve FDI and FTC. The systems models developed earlier are then considered to be a random process, i.e., as a Markovian process and based on the Markovian process, various performance measures are evaluated to check the correctness of the models developed. For this purpose, the conditions for model checking are formulated based on the constraint information available and analytical results are obtained.
The analytical and simulation results obtained show a good insight of the estimation based FDI schemes and conditions to achieve FTC in the systems considered using qualitative based approaches. Performance measures evaluated for the system models give an overall perspective view of the faulty behavior of the system and are highly helpful in analyzing and checking the correctness of the models developed. The proposed study is based on certain assumptions while modeling the systems using Petri nets, such as (i) the structure of the model is known initially and (ii) faults occurring one at a time, and the reasons to consider the same are explained in detail in this thesis. With suitable improvements, and considering various other issues of system safety studies, such as HAZard and OPerability (HAZOP) studies and Safety Analysis (SA), this thesis can be further enhanced</td></tr>
