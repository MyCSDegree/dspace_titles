Marine ecosystems are part of the earth's aquatic ecosystem. They include oceans, estuaries, salt marshes, lagoons, some tropical ecosystems, such as mangrove forests and coral reefs, rocky, sub tidal ecosystems, and shores. The main difference between this and other aquatic ecosystems is its salt content larger than that of fresh water (Tait and Dipper, 1998).
1.2 Marine biology
Marine biology is the scientific study of living organisms in the ocean or other marine or brackish bodies of water. Given that in biology many phyla, families and genera have some species that live in the sea and others that live on land, marine biology classifies species based on the environment rather than on taxonomy (David, 2007).
Marine life is a vast resource, providing food, medicine, and raw materials, in addition to helping to support recreation and tourism all over the world. At a fundamental level, marine life helps determine the very nature of our planet. Marine organisms contribute significantly to the oxygen cycle, and are involved in the regulation of the earth's climate. Shorelines are in part shaped and protected by marine life, and some marine organisms even help create new land.
Marine biology covers a great deal, from the microscopic, including plankton and phytoplankton, which can be as small as 0.02 micrometers and are both hugely important as the primary producers of the sea, to the huge cetaceans (whales) which reach up to a reported 48 meters (125 feet) in length (Firth, 1969).
The habitats studied by marine biology include everything from the tiny layers of surface water in which organisms and a biotic item may be trapped in surface tension between the ocean and atmosphere, to the depths of the abyssal trenches, sometimes 10,000 meters or more beneath the surface of the ocean. It studies habitats such as coral reefs, kelp forests, tide pools, muddy, sandy, and rocky bottoms, and the open ocean 1
(pelagic) zone, where solid objects are rare and the surface of the water is the only visible boundary.
A large amount of all life on Earth exists in the oceans. Exactly how large the proportion is is still unknown. While the oceans comprise about 71% of the Earth's surface, due to their depth they encompass about 300 times the habitable volume of the terrestrial habitats on Earth.
Many species are economically important to humans, including the food fishes. It is also becoming understood that the well-being of marine organisms and other organisms are linked in very fundamental ways. Human understanding is growing of the relationship between life in the sea and important cycles such as that of matter (such as the carbon cycle) and of air (such as Earth's respiration, and movement of energy through ecosystems). Large areas beneath the ocean surface still remain effectively unexplored.
1.3 Jellyfish
Jellyfish are marine invertebrates belonging to the class Scyphozoa of the phylum Cnidaria. They can be found in every ocean in the world and in some fresh waters. The term &quot;jellyfish&quot; is a common name, and therefore does not imply any systematic relationship to vertebrate fish. Jellyfish are cnidarians. The term &quot;jellyfish&quot; is also applied to some close relatives of true scyphozoans, such as the Hydrozoa and the Cubozoa.
1.3.1 Anatomy and morphology
The body of an adult jellyfish consists of a bell shape producing jelly and enclosing its internal structure, from which tentacles are suspended. Each tentacle is covered with cells called cnidocytes that can sting or kill other animals. Most jellyfish use these cells to secure prey or for defense. Others, such as the Rhizostomae, do not have tentacles at all (Teresa Dodd and Butera, 2005).
Jellyfish lack basic sensory organs and a brain, but their nervous systems and rhopalia allow them to perceive stimuli, such as light and odor, and respond quickly. They feed on small fish and zooplankton that become caught in their tentacles. Most jellyfish are passive drifters and slow swimmers, as their shape is not hydrodynamic.
2
Instead, they move so as to create a current forcing the prey within reach of their tentacles. They do this by rhythmically opening and closing their bell-like body. Their digestive system is incomplete: the same orifice is used to take in food and expel waste. The body of an adult is made up of 94–98% water. The bell consists of a layer of epidermis, gastrodermis, and a thick, intervening layer called mesoglea that produces most of the jelly.
1.3.2 Body systems
A jellyfish detects the touch of other animals using a nervous system called a &quot;nerve net&quot;, located in its epidermis. Touch stimuli are conducted by nerve rings, through the rhopalial lappet, located around the animal's body, to the nerve cells. Jellyfish also have ocelli: light-sensitive organs that do not form images but are used to determine up from down, responding to sunlight shining on the water's surface.
Jellyfish don't have a specialized digestive, osmoregulatory, central nervous, respiratory, or circulatory systems. They digest using the gastrodermal lining of the gastrovascular cavity, where nutrients are absorbed. They do not need a respiratory system since their skin is thin enough that the body is oxygenated by diffusion. They have limited control over movement and mostly free-float, but can use the hydrostatic skeleton of the water pouch to accomplish vertical movement through pulsations of the disc-like body (Keegan and Macfarlane, 1963).
The outer side of a jellyfish is lined with a jelly-like material called ectoplasm (ecto meaning outer and plasma meaning cytoplasm). The ectoplasm typically contains a smaller amount of protein granules and other organic compounds than inner cytoplasm, also referred to as endoplasm (endo meaning inner).
Many species of jellyfish are capable of congregating into large swarms or &quot;blooms&quot;, consisting of hundreds of individuals. The formation of these blooms is a complex process that depends on ocean currents, nutrients, temperature and ambient oxygen concentrations. Jellyfish sometimes mass breed during blooms. During such times of rapid population expansion, some people will raise ecological concerns about the potential noxious effects of a jellyfish &quot;outbreak&quot;.
3
According to Claudia Mills of the University of Washington, the frequency of jellyfish blooms may be attributed to man's impact on marine systems. She says that the breeding jellyfish may merely be filling ecological niches formerly occupied by overfished creatures. Jellyfish researcher Marsh Youngbluth further clarifies that &quot;jellyfish feed on the same kinds of prey as adult and young fishes, so if fish are removed from the equation, jellyfish are likely to move in.&quot;
Increased nutrients in the water, ascribed to agricultural runoff, have also been cited as an antecedent to the proliferation of jellyfish. Monty Graham, of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab in Alabama, says that &quot;ecosystems in which there are high levels of nutrients, provide nourishment for the small organisms on which jellyfish feed. In waters where there is eutrophication, low oxygen levels often result, favoring jellyfish as they thrive in less oxygen-rich water than fish can tolerate. The fact that jellyfish are increasing is a symptom of something happening in the ecosystem.&quot;
By sampling sea life in a heavily fished region off the coast of Namibia, researchers found that jellyfish have overtaken fish in terms of biomass. The findings represent a careful, quantitative analysis of what has been called a &quot;jellyfish explosion&quot; following intense fishing in the area in the last few decades. The findings were reported by Andrew Brierley of the University of St. Andrews and his colleagues in the July 12, 2006 issue of the Journal, Current Biology.
Areas which have been seriously affected by jellyfish blooms include the northern Gulf of Mexico. In that case, Graham states, &quot;Moon jellies have formed a kind of gelatinous net that stretches from end to end across the gulf.
1.3.3 Life history
Most jellyfish pass through two distinct life history phases (body forms) during their life cycle. The first is the polypoid stage, when the jellyfish takes the form of either a sessile stalk which catches passing food, or a similar free-floating configuration. The polyp's mouth and tentacles face upwards, reminiscent of the hydroid stage of the somewhat closely related anthozoan polyps, also of the phylum Cnidaria.
In the second stage, the jellyfish is known as a medusa. Medusae have a radially symmetric, umbrella-shaped body called a bell. The medusa's tentacles are fringe-like
4
protrusions from the border of the bell, (Medusa is also the Hebrew, Spanish, Italian, Hungarian, Russian and Bulgarian word for jellyfish).
Jellyfish are dioecious; that is, they are either male or female. In most cases, to reproduce, a male releases his sperm into the surrounding water. The sperm then swims into the mouth of the female, allowing the fertilization of the ova. However, moon jellies use a different process. The eggs become lodged in pits on the oral arms, which form a temporary brood chamber to accommodate fertilization.
After fertilization and initial growth, a larval form, called the planula, develops from the egg. The planula is a small larva covered with cilia. It settles onto a firm surface and develops into a polyp. The polyp is cup-shaped with tentacles surrounding a single orifice, resembling a tiny sea anemone. After an interval of growth, the polyp begins reproducing asexually by budding and is called a segmenting polyp, or a scyphistome. New scyphistomae may be produced by budding or new, immature jellies called ephyra may be formed (Figure 1). Many jellyfish species are capable of producing new medusae by budding directly from the medusan stage.
Most jellyfish have a lifespan of two and a half months; few live longer than six months but one species can live as long as 30 years and another species, T. nutricula, is effectively immortal.

1.3.4 In Biotechnology
In 1961, green fluorescent protein was discovered in the jellyfish Aequorea victoria by scientists studying bioluminescence. This protein has since become a quite useful tool in biology. Its use is mainly for scientists studying in which tissues genes are expressed. The technique uses genetic engineering fuse the gene of interest to the gene of GFP. The fused DNA is then put into a cell, to generate either a cell line or (via IVF techniques) an entire animal bearing the gene. In the cell or animal, the artificial gene gets turned on the same tissues and the same time as the normal gene. But instead of making the normal protein, the gene makes GFP. One can then find out what tissues express that protein or at what stage of development - by shining light on the animal or cell, and looking for the green fluorescence. The fluorescence shows you where the gene you are interested in is expressed. Jellyfish are also harvested for their collagen, which can be used for a variety of scientific applications including the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
1.3.5 Types of Jellyfish
There are more then 350 different species of jellyfish known; however, scientist estimate there may be 2,000.
The principal groups which contain jellyfish are (Keegan and Macfarlane, 1963):
• Semaeostomeae - The biggest jellyfish of the world (eg. lions'mane)
• Rhizostomeae - Ones without tentacles (eg. cassiopea)
• Coronatae - Ones with two-lobed umbrella
• Cubozoa (box jelly) - The most dangerous ones
• Anthoathecatae, Limnomedusae, Leptothecatae, Trachymedusae - Small hydrozoan jellyfish
• Staurozoa - Small unusual jellyfish
• Portuguese man o'war is not a jellyfish; it is a colony of hydrozoan polyps.

1.6 Importance of the project
The major Marine Research Institutes in India, such as, Zoological Survey of India-Marine Biology Station (ZSI-MBS), National Institute of Oceanology (NIO), National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), Marine Research Institute-Annamalai University, Central Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI), etc., are studying the marine diversity along the Eastern and the Western coast of India. Analytical studies are going on for common marine fishes, crabs, lobsters and mussels. But, very less initiative has been taken to study the characteristics of the jellyfish venom. Jellyfish sting is fairly common among the fishermen along the coastlines of India. It mainly causes local irritation. Very few cases are serious, which are treated by untested local methods as there is no antivenom for a jellyfish sting. In fact, there is only one species of jellyfish, for which antivenom is available, that is, for the Australian Box Jellyfish, Chinorex fleckeri. Our initiative in taking up this project is to through some light on the nature of the venom of two particular species of jellyfishes that are considered by the local fisherman as a nuisance, found along the Tamil Nadu coast.</td></tr>
