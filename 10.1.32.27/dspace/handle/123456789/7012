<tr><td class="metadataFieldLabel">Abstract:&nbsp;</td><td class="metadataFieldValue">Interpreting and understanding organizational culture is an important
activity for managers, researchers and consultants because it affects strategic
development, productivity and learning at all levels. Cultural assumptions can
both enable and constrain what organizations are able to do. Understanding how
committed employees are within an organization is a valuable tool for managing
and fostering a successful work environment. A continued appreciation of
employee commitment is especially beneficial following organizational change
as it has been shown that change inevitably impacts commitment levels to some
degree. Viewing this, this study aims in analyzing organisational culture and
commitment of IT professionals of Indian and foreign managed IT firms in
Chennai.
This study was focussed to identify organisational culture and
commitment dimensions which influenced the IT professionals. It was also aimed
to investigate the effect of organizational culture dimensions on organisational
commitment dimensions.
Among the different IT hubs in Tamil Nadu, Chennai city has been
selected for the present study. The lists of IT firms are classified into Indian
managed and Foreign managed IT firms. The foreign managed IT firms namely
IBM, CTS, Accenture, Oracle, HP, and Polaris and the Indian managed IT
firms namely Infosys, HCL, Wipro, TCS, Satyam and Saskan are randomly
selected. 200 employees from Indian managed IT firms and 200 from foreign
managed IT firms, thus totally 400 employees are selected for the present study
by adopting convenient sampling technique.
vii
The data and information collected through pre-tested, structured, direct
interview method from respondents pertains to the year April 2009 – Jan 2010.
To understand the socio-economic factors of employees of IT industries,
descriptive statistics and frequency distribution are worked out. Simple
correlation has been used to analyze the relationship between the socio-economic
factors and organizational cultural and commitment of employees.
In order to identify the factors affecting organizational culture and
commitment, factor analysis has been adopted and to understand and elucidate
the differences in culture and commitment of the employees, Chi-Square Test has
been employed. In order to discriminate the employees based on the
organizational culture and organizational commitment, discriminant analysis has
been employed.
With a view to examine the effect of organizational cultural dimensions
on organizational commitment, the multiple-regression model was formulated
and carried out. Besides, mean score have been worked out for identifying the
key dimensions of both organizational culture and commitment.
29 Organisational Cultural dimensions and 15 Organisational
Commitment dimensions were identified. The study revealed that the cultural
dimensions of Problem Pass, Truth, Freedom, Discussion, Accountability,
Appear, Independent Actions, Doing Things, Time, and Organisational Vitality
were the common dimensions influencing the organizational culture in both the
Indian and foreign managed IT firms.
The cultural dimensions of problem pass, concerned, prevention, adoptive,
doing things, problem, obey, encourage, discussion, mistakes, support, appear,
truth and trust are the common dimensions forming the factors in both the Indian
and foreign managed IT firms.
viii
The commitment dimensions of self, personally, options, feel, owe,
career, leave, disturbed, benefit, attached and problems are the common
dimensions forming the factors in both the Indian and foreign managed IT firms.
The commitment dimensions of self, personally, options, feel, owe,
career, leave, disturbed, benefit, attached and problems are the common
dimensions forming the factors in both the Indian and foreign managed IT firms.
The results of Chi-Square test show that there is a significant difference in
perception of the employees on organizational cultural dimensions in both the
Indian and foreign managed IT firms. The cultural dimensions of support and
share are the best discriminating variables in both Indian and foreign managed IT
firms.
The cultural dimension of independent is the only dimension positively
influencing the organizational commitment in both the Indian and foreign
managed IT firms. The cultural dimension of obey is negatively influencing the
organizational commitment in foreign managed IT firms.
The present study indicates that there is difference in practicing
organisational culture in both Indian and foreign managed IT firms. Arising out
of the present study, suggestions are made for improving organisational culture
and commitment in Indian and foreign managed IT firms.
The findings of this study also offer a foundation for considering cultural
change programs as a means of OD intervention. The foreign managed IT firms
are characterized by better work group norms. From this point of view, there is a
greater need to change the working culture of Indian managed IT firms in order
to achieve better working environment.
Organizational culture is a manifestation of the collective values,
principles, interests and actions of people working together. Thus, creating the
culture of team work and learning are very significant in the face of a complex
and fast-changing environment. Organizations are beginning to make meaningful
ix
advancements towards “growing” loyal employees. There is never an ideal time
to conduct an investigation on employee commitment within any organization.
The findings of this research work may have relevance to other types of
organisations like academics institutions, service organisations, voluntary
agencies etc. Companies in various industries or countries have divergent
interpretations in different constructs. It would be very interesting to perform
comparisons and obtain further findings.</td></tr>
