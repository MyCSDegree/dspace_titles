A composite material which consists essentially of a binding medium, within which are embedded particles or fragments of a relative inert filler in portland cement concrete, the binder is a mixture of portland cement, possibly additional cementitious materials such as fly ash and water.
1.2 Bio-Mineralization
Natural processes, such as weathering, faults, land subsidence, earthquakes, and human activities create fractures and fissures in concrete structures and historical stone monuments. These fractures and fissures are detrimental since they can reduce the service life of the structure. In the case of monuments and buildings of historic importance, these cracks tend to disfigure and destroy the structure. Use of synthetic agents such as epoxies for remediating these structures will reduce the aesthetic appearance of the structure.
Therefore a novel technique for remediating damaged structural formations has been developed by employing a selective microbial plugging process, in which microbial metabolic activities promote calcium carbonate (calcite) precipitation . This technique is called microbiologically enhanced crack remediation (MECR). This technique comes under a broader category of science called biomineralization. It is a process by which living organisms form inorganic solids. Living organisms including bacteria have the ability to form bones and teeth, to natural pearls and shells. As a microbial sealant, CaCO3 exhibited its positive potential to selectively consolidate simulated fractures and surface fissures in granites. Microbial calcite precipitation was quantified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and visualized by SEM.
Surface treatments play an important role in the protection of construction materials from the ingress of water and other deleterious substances. Due to the negative side-effects of some of the conventional techniques, bacterial induced carbonate mineralization has been proposed as a novel and environmental friendly strategy for the protection of stone and mortar. This paper reports the effects of bacterial CaCO3 precipitation on parameters affecting the durability of concrete and mortar. Pure and mixed cultures of ureolytic bacteria were compared for their effectiveness in relation to conventional surface treatments.
Bacterial deposition of a layer of calcite on the surface of the specimens resulted in a decrease of capillary water uptake and permeability towards gas. This bacterial treatment resulted in a limited change of the chromatic aspect of mortar and concrete surfaces. The type of bacterial culture and medium composition had a profound impact on CaCO3 crystal morphology. The use of pure cultures resulted in a more pronounced decrease in uptake of water, respectively less pronounced change in the chromatic aspect, compared to the use of mixed ureolytic cultures as a paste. The results obtained with cultures of the species Bacillus sphaericus were comparable to the ones obtained with conventional water repellents.
1.3 Bacterial Concrete
Bacterial concrete refers to a new generation of concrete in which selective cementation by microbiologically-induced CaCO3 precipitation has been introduced for remediation of micro cracks. Considerable research on carbonate precipitation is done by selecting ureolytic bacteria but very limited work has been reported on the application part of it. Bacterial urease enzymes degrade urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide, which lead to increase in pH of the media and carbonate precipitation. Various researchers have confirmed the persistence of organic CaCO3 precipitate in the environment for an extended period of time using Bacillus pasteurii.
Considerable research on carbonate precipitation by bacteria has been performed using ureolytic bacteria. These bacteria are able to influence the precipitation of calcium carbonate by the production of a Urease enzyme. This enzyme
catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to CO2 and ammonia, resulting in an increase of the pH and carbonate concentration in the bacterial environment. Once super saturation is achieved precipitation of calcium carbonate crystals occurs by heterogeneous nucleation on bacterial cell walls. Research has indicated that a concrete which is low in permeation properties lasts longer without exhibiting signs of distress and deterioration.
Bacillus sphaericus yet other ureolytic bacteria which showed strong potential in precipitating the insoluble calcium carbonate were selected as a test organism.
1.4 Bacillus sphaericus
B. sphaericus LMG 225 57 (BCCM, Gent) was used for this study. Selection of this strain was based upon earlier work by our research group. This strain showed a high urease activity, a very negative ζ-potential and a continuous formation of dense calcium carbonate crystals in liquid medium. B. sphaericus is unlike to cause human disease. No measurable health effects were seen in laboratory animals that were exposed to large concentrations of B. sphaericus by multiple routes of exposure. Cases involving human health effects following exposure to this organism are extremely rare. Mild eye and skin irritation may occur in humans following contact with B. sphaericus.
1.5 Background
Bacterial concrete refers to a new generation of concrete in which selective cementation of porous media by microbiologically-induced CaCO3 has been introduced for remediation of damaged structural formation or micro cracks. Much of work carried out in South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Rapid City, USA has indicated improvement in strength and durability characteristics of concrete when certain bacteria are introduced. However the work on this area in India is limited.
Cracks and fissures are common problem in building structures, payments and historic monuments. Methods currently used for crack remediation often use synthetic polymers that need to be applied repeatedly. A novel approach in crack remediation is
microbiologically enhanced crack remediation using bioconcrete which is a microbiologically induced calcium precipitate by the action of urease enzyme. The enzyme urease hydrolyses urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide. The ammonia increases the pH of the surrounding which in turn induces the calcium carbonate precipitation .It is hypothesized that urease is the main component that initiates the microbial calcium carbonate precipitation which acts as a biocement in strengthening the building structures.</td></tr>
